    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>
      The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
      species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
      junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
      is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China
      according to estimations in the study of the sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for
      special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
      period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now keep chickens primarily as
      a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[5] up from more than 19
      billion in 2011.[6] There are more chickens in the world than any other
      bird.[6] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth,
      folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

    <p>
      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of
      within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[7] but the clade found
      in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
      Indian subcontinent.
    </p>
    <p>
      From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and
      to Greece by the 5th century BC.[8] Fowl have been known in Egypt since
      the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
      come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the
      annals of Thutmose III.[9][10][11]
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2011 a study in genetic and archaeological[12] evidence conclude that
      the origin of the modern-day chicken is from South-East Asia. This is the
      area east of India and south of China.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and
      an adult female is called a hen.[13][14]
    </p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
      originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the
      sexual connotation of the original English cock,[26][27][28] and is widely
      used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to
      sleep at night.[29]
    </p>
    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores.[30] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes,[31] or sometimes young mice.[32] The average chicken may live for
      5–10 years, depending on the breed.[33] The world's oldest known chicken
      lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.[34]
    </p>
    <p>
      Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage
      of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks
      ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder
      colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds,
      such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck
      feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by
      looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the
      male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female
      chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy
      crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of
      skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and
      other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles.
      Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds
      these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found
      in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
      chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[35]
    </p>
    <p>
      Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although
      lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such
      as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens
      may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally
      do so only to flee perceived danger.

    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social behavior</h4>
    <p>
        Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order', with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.
    </p>
    <h4>Vocalizations</h4>
    <p>
        When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
        A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[37] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground
    </p>
    <h4>Courtship</h4>
    <p>
        To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a 'circle dance'), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[41] The dance triggers a response in the hen[41] and when she responds to his 'call', the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating
